Place Leaflet assets here to avoid external egress.
Files expected:
- leaflet.css
- leaflet.js

Download a compatible Leaflet release from https://leafletjs.com/download.html and copy the files here.

Optional local basemap image (used by imageOverlay in code):
- ../assets/australia-basemap.png
Adjust bounds in main.js if you use a different image or projection.
