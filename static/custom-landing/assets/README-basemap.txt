Optional: Drop a local raster basemap image named australia-basemap.png in this folder.
The app uses an L.imageOverlay with bounds roughly covering Australia:
SW [-44.0, 111.0], NE [-10.0, 154.0]. Adjust in main.js if needed.
If no basemap is present, sample markers will render over a blank background.
